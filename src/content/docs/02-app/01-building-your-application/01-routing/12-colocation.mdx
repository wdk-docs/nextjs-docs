除了[路由文件夹和文件约定](/docs/getting-started/project-structure#app-routing-conventions), Next.js 是关于如何组织和并置项目文件的。

此页面共享可用于组织项目的默认行为和功能。

## 默认情况下安全主机代管

在`app`目录中, [嵌套文件夹层次结构](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#route-segments)定义路由结构。

每个文件夹表示映射到 URL 路径中相应段的路由段。

然而，即使路由结构是通过文件夹定义的，在将`page.js`或`route.js`文件添加到路由段之前，路由是**不可公开访问的**。

<Image
  alt="一个图表，显示在将page.js或route.js文件添加到路由段之前，路由是如何不可公开访问的。"
  srclight="/docs/light/project-organization-not-routable.png"
  srcdark="/docs/dark/project-organization-not-routable.png"
  width="1600"
  height="444"
/>

而且，即使路由被公开访问，也只有`page.js`或`route.js`返回**的**内容被发送到客户端。

<Image
  alt="A diagram showing how page.js and route.js files make routes publicly accessible."
  srclight="/docs/light/project-organization-routable.png"
  srcdark="/docs/dark/project-organization-routable.png"
  width="1600"
  height="687"
/>

这意味着**项目文件**可以在`app`目录中的路由段内**安全地并置**，而不会意外地被路由。

<Image
  alt="即使段包含page.js或route.js文件，显示共有项目文件的图表也不可路由。"

## 项目组织特点

Next.js provides several features to help you organize your project.

### 专用文件夹

Private folders can be created by prefixing a folder with an underscore: `_folderName`

This indicates the folder is a private implementation detail and should not be considered by the routing system, thereby **opting the folder and all its subfolders** out of routing.

<Image
  alt="An example folder structure using private folders"
  srclight="/docs/light/project-organization-private-folders.png"
  srcdark="/docs/dark/project-organization-private-folders.png"
  width="1600"
  height="849"
/>

Since files in the `app` directory can be [safely colocated by default](#safe-colocation-by-default), private folders are not required for colocation. However, they can be useful for:

- Separating UI logic from routing logic.
- Consistently organizing internal files across a project and the Next.js ecosystem.
- Sorting and grouping files in code editors.
- Avoiding potential naming conflicts with future Next.js file conventions.

> **Good to know**
>
> - While not a framework convention, you might also consider marking files outside private folders as "private" using the same underscore pattern.
> - You can create URL segments that start with an underscore by prefixing the folder name with `%5F` (the URL-encoded form of an underscore): `%5FfolderName`.
> - If you don't use private folders, it would be helpful to know Next.js [special file conventions](/docs/getting-started/project-structure#routing-files) to prevent unexpected naming conflicts.

### 路由组

Route groups can be created by wrapping a folder in parenthesis: `(folderName)`

This indicates the folder is for organizational purposes and should **not be included** in the route's URL path.

<Image

  srclight="/docs/light/project-organization-route-groups.png"
  srcdark="/docs/dark/project-organization-route-groups.png"
  width="1600"
  height="849"
/>

Route groups are useful for:

- [Organizing routes into groups](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups#organize-routes-without-affecting-the-url-path) e.g. by site section, intent, or team.
- Enabling nested layouts in the same route segment level:
  - [Creating multiple nested layouts in the same segment, including multiple root layouts](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups#creating-multiple-root-layouts)
  - [Adding a layout to a subset of routes in a common segment](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups#opting-specific-segments-into-a-layout)

### `src` 目录

Next.js supports storing application code (including `app`) inside an optional [`src` directory](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/src-directory). This separates application code from project configuration files which mostly live in the root of a project.

<Image
  alt="An example folder structure with the `src` directory"
  srclight="/docs/light/project-organization-src-directory.png"
  srcdark="/docs/dark/project-organization-src-directory.png"
  width="1600"
  height="687"
/>

### 模块路径别名

Next.js supports [Module Path Aliases](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/absolute-imports-and-module-aliases) which make it easier to read and maintain imports across deeply nested project files.

```jsx filename="app/dashboard/settings/analytics/page.js"
// before
import { Button } from "../../../components/button";

// after
import { Button } from "@/components/button";
```

## 项目组织策略

There is no "right" or "wrong" way when it comes to organizing your own files and folders in a Next.js project.

The following section lists a very high-level overview of common strategies. The simplest takeaway is to choose a strategy that works for you and your team and be consistent across the project.

> **Good to know**: In our examples below, we're using `components` and `lib` folders as generalized placeholders, their naming has no special framework significance and your projects might use other folders like `ui`, `utils`, `hooks`, `styles`, etc.

### Store project files outside of `app`

This strategy stores all application code in shared folders in the **root of your project** and keeps the `app` directory purely for routing purposes.

  srclight="/docs/light/project-organization-project-root.png"
  srcdark="/docs/dark/project-organization-project-root.png"
  width="1600"
  height="849"
/>

### 将项目文件存储在`app`内的顶级文件夹中

This strategy stores all application code in shared folders in the **root of the `app` directory**.

<Image
  alt="An example folder structure with project files inside app"
  srclight="/docs/light/project-organization-app-root.png"
  srcdark="/docs/dark/project-organization-app-root.png"
  width="1600"
  height="849"
/>

### 按要素或管线拆分项目文件

This strategy stores globally shared application code in the root `app` directory and **splits** more specific application code into the route segments that use them.
