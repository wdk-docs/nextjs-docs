In the `app` directory, nested folders are normally mapped to URL paths. However, you can mark a folder as a **Route Group** to prevent the folder from being included in the route's URL path.

这允许您将管段和项目文件组织到逻辑组中，而不会影响 URL 路径结构。

路由组对于:

- [Organizing routes into groups](#organize-routes-without-affecting-the-url-path) e.g. by site section, intent, or team.
- Enabling [nested layouts](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) in the same route segment level:
  - [Creating multiple nested layouts in the same segment, including multiple root layouts](#creating-multiple-root-layouts)
  - [Adding a layout to a subset of routes in a common segment](#opting-specific-segments-into-a-layout)

## 习俗

A route group can be created by wrapping a folder's name in parenthesis: `(folderName)`

## 示例

### 在不影响 URL 路径的情况下组织路由

To organize routes without affecting the URL, create a group to keep related routes together. The folders in parenthesis will be omitted from the URL (e.g. `(marketing)` or `(shop)`).

/>

Even though routes inside `(marketing)` and `(shop)` share the same URL hierarchy, you can create a different layout for each group by adding a `layout.js` file inside their folders.

  height="768"
/>

### 将特定线段选择到布局中

To opt specific routes into a layout, create a new route group (e.g. `(shop)`) and move the routes that share the same layout into the group (e.g. `account` and `cart`). The routes outside of the group will not share the layout (e.g. `checkout`).

<Image
  alt="Route Groups with Opt-in Layouts"
  srclight="/docs/light/route-group-opt-in-layouts.png"
  srcdark="/docs/dark/route-group-opt-in-layouts.png"
  width="1600"
  height="930"
/>

### 创建多个根布局

To create multiple [root layouts](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#root-layout-required), remove the top-level `layout.js` file, and add a `layout.js` file inside each route groups. This is useful for partitioning an application into sections that have a completely different UI or experience. The `<html>` and `<body>` tags need to be added to each root layout.

<Image
  alt="Route Groups with Multiple Root Layouts"
  srclight="/docs/light/route-group-multiple-root-layouts.png"
  srcdark="/docs/dark/route-group-multiple-root-layouts.png"
  width="1600"
  height="687"
/>

In the example above, both `(marketing)` and `(shop)` have their own root layout.

> **Good to know**:
>
> - The naming of route groups has no special significance other than for organization. They do not affect the URL path.
> - Routes that include a route group **should not** resolve to the same URL path as other routes. For example, since route groups don't affect URL structure, `(marketing)/about/page.js` and `(shop)/about/page.js` would both resolve to `/about` and cause an error.
> - If you use multiple root layouts without a top-level `layout.js` file, your home `page.js` file should be defined in one of the route groups, For example: `app/(marketing)/page.js`.
> - Navigating **across multiple root layouts** will cause a **full page load** (as opposed to a client-side navigation). For example, navigating from `/cart` that uses `app/(shop)/layout.js` to `/blog` that uses `app/(marketing)/layout.js` will cause a full page load. This **only** applies to multiple root layouts.
