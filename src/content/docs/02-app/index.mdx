description: 使用带有Next.js和React最新功能的新应用路由器，包括布局、服务器组件、暂停等。
---

The Next.js App Router is a new paradigm for building applications using React's latest features. If you're already familiar with Next.js, you'll find that the App Router is a natural evolution of the existing file-system based router in the [Pages Router](/docs/pages).

For new applications, **we recommend using the App Router**. For existing applications, you can [incrementally adopt the App Router](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration). It's also possible to use both routers in the same application.

## 常见问题

### 如何访问布局中的请求对象？

You intentionally cannot access the raw request object. However, you can access [`headers`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers) and [`cookies`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) through server-only functions. You can also [set cookies](#how-can-i-set-cookies).

[Layouts](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#layouts) do not rerender. They can be cached and reused to avoid unnecessary computation when navigating between pages. By restricting layouts from accessing the raw request, Next.js can prevent the execution of potentially slow or expensive user code within the layout, which could negatively impact performance.

This design also enforces consistent and predictable behavior for layouts across different pages, which simplifies development and debugging.

Depending on the UI pattern you're building, [Parallel Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) allow you to render multiple pages in the same layout, and pages have access to the route segments as well as the URL search params.

### 如何访问页面上的 URL？

By default, pages are Server Components. You can access the route segments through the [`params`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#params-optional) prop and the URL search params through the [`searchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#searchparams-optional) prop for a given page.

If you are using Client Components, you can use [`usePathname`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname), [`useSelectedLayoutSegment`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segment), and [`useSelectedLayoutSegments`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segments) for more complex routes.

Further, depending on the UI pattern you're building, [Parallel Routes](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) allow you to render multiple pages in the same layout, and pages have access to the route segments as well as the URL search params.

### 如何从服务器组件重定向？

You can use [`redirect`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/redirect) to redirect from a page to a relative or absolute URL. [`redirect`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/redirect) is a temporary (307) redirect, while [`permanentRedirect`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/permanentRedirect) is a permanent (308) redirect. When these functions are used while streaming UI, they will insert a meta tag to emit the redirect on the client side.

### 如何使用应用程序路由器进行身份验证？

Here are some common authentication solutions that support the App Router:

- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/nextjs#in-app-router)
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs)
- [Auth0](https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0#app-router)
- [Stytch](https://stytch.com/docs/example-apps/frontend/nextjs)
- [Kinde](https://kinde.com/docs/developer-tools/nextjs-sdk/)
- Or manually handling sessions or JWTs

### 如何设置 cookie？

You can set cookies in [Server Actions](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#cookies) or [Route Handlers](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) using the [`cookies`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) function.

Since HTTP does not allow setting cookies after streaming starts, you cannot set cookies from a page or layout directly. You can also set cookies from [Middleware](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#using-cookies).

### 如何构建多租户应用程序？

If you are looking to build a single Next.js application that serves multiple tenants, we have [built an example](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/platforms-starter-kit) showing our recommended architecture.

### 如何使应用程序路由器缓存无效？

There are multiple layers of caching in Next.js, and thus, multiple ways to invalidate different parts of the cache. [Learn more about caching](/docs/app/building-your-application/caching).

### App 路由器上是否有任何全面的开源应用程序？

对您可以查看[Next.js 商业](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-commerce)或[平台入门套件](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/platforms-starter-kit)关于使用开源应用程序路由器的两个更大的例子。
